# Dungeon-Escape
"Dungeon Escape" is an interactive computer game with a graphical user interface in which the user can either play in single-player or multi-player mode. The game follows the well-established genre of the platform game. This is a style of game-play that gives a 2D side-on view of the gameâ€™s environment, where "gravity" affects dynamic objects as they accelerate towards the bottom of the game window.

In Single Player mode, the Player will navigate through a map consisting of platforms, obstacles and Enemies to finally reach the door which will take them to a new level. Each Player will have three Lives at the start of each game. When they lose all three of their Lives they will have to start their current level over again. A Player cannot possess more than three Lives at any given time. The player will also be collecting coins which spawn in certain spots on the map. Life boxes will also be available to pick up in certain places. Upon picking one of these up, a player will have an extra life added. In Multi-player mode, multiple players can connect to a server and battle against each other. Every 15 seconds, a life will be taken from the player with the least amount of coins. In this mode, the players will also be able to pick up Attack gems which they can use against another player to take a life from him. Freeze boxes will also be available and when a player uses one of these, all of the other players will be frozen for 5 seconds.
